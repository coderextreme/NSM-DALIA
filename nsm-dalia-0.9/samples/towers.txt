The ground is a place
A disk is a thing I can move
I can move a disk to the ground
One thing is on top of another thing:
   this one thing is above the other thing
   this one thing touches the other thing
I can move a disk to be on top of another disk
A Hanoi Tower is 
  one disk on the ground or
  one disk on top of a Hanoi Tower
    this disk is smaller than all other disks in this Hanoi Tower

My Hanoi Tower is in one place
There are two other places on the ground
One of these two places is near my Hanoi Tower
The other of the two other places is far from my Hanoi Tower
The near other place is near the far other place [animation hint]
There can be Hanoi Towers in these two other places
I want to move my Hanoi Tower disks like in a game:
   In one moment, I move one disk, one time
   I can move this disk to one of these two other places
   I can move this disk to my Hanoi Tower's place
   I can not move this disk from a Hanoi Tower to the same tower
   After I move this disk, this disk is on top of a Hanoi Tower
   I cannot move disks to any other place

My Hanoi Tower has N[=one,two,three...] disks
There are no Hanoi Towers in these two other places now

How do I move all of my Hanoi Towerâ€™s disks to the far place in this game?
